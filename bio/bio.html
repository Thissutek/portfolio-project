                    while also bringing a dynamic and engaging visual experience to my projects through motion design. Furthermore, my experience
                    in UX/UI design allows me to create user-friendly and intuitive interfaces. Overall, my skills in full-stack development,
                    motion design, and UX/UI align together perfectly to create engaging and dynamic digital experiences.</p>

                and develop a unique style within digital media. Throughout my journey at OCAD, I had the opportunity to collaborate with fellow students 
                and industry professionals on various projects, from concept development to production and execution. This experience allowed me to hone my 
                skills in visual communication, user experience design, and motion graphics, and helped me gain a deep understanding of how digital media can 
                be used to engage and inspire audiences. Overall, my time at OCAD has shaped me into a versatile artist and designer, with a passion for creating

            <h1>Brainstation/Coursera</h1>
            <p>After graduating from OCAD University, I continued to expand my knowledge and skills in UX/UI design by completing courses with BrainStation 
                and Google on Coursera. These courses allowed me to stay up-to-date with the latest design trends, learn new tools and techniques, and gain practical 
                experience by working on real-world projects. Through these continued studies, I have further developed my ability to create intuitive and user-friendly 
                digital products.</p>
